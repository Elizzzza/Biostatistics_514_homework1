## Homework 1 

- Please read the class site for details on appropriate answering of questions. Discussion of the questions with 
other students, TAs, the instructor, or on the class discussion board is permitted, but you should write up your 
own answers in your own words. 
- Upload your answers to the class site – see under course navigation for “Assignments”. 
- Raw code should not appear in your solutions, but include your code (your .R script file, or equivalent) as an 
appendix. As well as making your work reproducible, this helps the grader see exactly what you have done – and 
help with any problems. 

### Q1 – Thinking scientifically 

Some adolescents using social media (e.g. Facebook) to follow their peers’ lives can have feelings of low self-esteem, 
inadequacy and inferiority about their own life. As described in this article, “When kids scroll through their feeds and see 
how great everyone seems, it only adds to the pressure.” What statistical artifact from Chapter 1 could contribute to an 
entirely normal adolescent feeling this way? Write a paragraph explaining your answer. 

### Q2 – Thinking scientifically 

Risk factors for rare diseases are often assessed using case-control studies (see slide 2.23 if these are unfamiliar) based 
in referent databases. Referent databases collect family histories of cases, and the entire family – i.e. all cases and 
controls – are included in the database if at least one family member was diagnosed with the disease of interest. 

In this design, family size can often appear to be a risk factor for the disease – families containing cases tend to be larger 
than families (in the general population, not the referent database) who are all controls. 

Which statistical artefact from Chapter 1 does this illustrate? Write a paragraph explaining your answer. You may 
include diagrams if you find them helpful – or not, if you don’t. 

### Q3 – Quantifying distributions 

Weather forecasters often make statements like “there is an 80% chance of rain tomorrow in Seattle”.  

a. Describe carefully what this might mean; what exactly could “rain tomorrow” mean? And 80% is a 
proportion of exactly what? (Note there is no single uniquely right answer to either question; state clearly 
what you think the potential answer(s) could be.) 

b. State a numerical, rain-related outcome that can be measured every day and described and estimated less 
ambiguously than “rain tomorrow”. 

### Q4 – Clustering variables  

Colon cancer can in many cases be prevented through screening, and various screening tools are available. Some are 
more/less invasive than others, and these tend to be administered more/less frequently. To help schedule upcoming 
screenings for patients at risk of colon cancer, it helps to know what screens have recently been done. One detailed way 
to find out a patient’s history is to have them complete a checklist of procedures they have undergone, e.g. 
 
Which of these was your previous screening test? 
-  Endoscopy 
-  Flexible Sigmoidoscopy 
-  Fecal-occult blood test (FOBT) 
-  Fecal immunochemical test (FIT) 
 
Unfortunately, questions like this produce unreliable responses, as patients confuse the various screening procedures, 
and forget details of them including their names. By thinking carefully about what those procedures involve, give a much 
simpler question with a single Yes/No answer, that would capture most of the information the detailed approach seeks 
to obtain. 
 
*Hint: look up the screening procedures, if you don’t know what they involve, and in particular how they are 
administered.*  

### Q5 – Prediction versus causation 

a. The number of ambulances attending a road traffic accident is a very good predictor of how many fatalities will 
occur due to that accident; more ambulances tend to be present at accidents with more fatalities. Briefly (i.e. in a 
sentence or two) explain why we don’t therefore reduce fatalities by sending fewer ambulances. 

b. The graph below shows data from 61 countries’ maternal mortality rate (MMR, the annual number of female 
deaths per 100,000 live births from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management 
excluding accidental or incidental causes) versus television ownership per household.  
 
The data is from 2010 and can be accessed here and here. Looking at the original data may help you answer the 
questions below. 

i. Give one reason, with explanation, why donating TV sets to the countries with worst MMR rates would 
not improve maternal mortality there. 

ii. Give one reason, with explanation, why donating TV sets to the countries with worst MMR rates might 
improve maternal mortality there. 

iii. Which of i), ii) do you think is the more plausible outcome of donating TV sets? 

### Q6 – Looking ahead 
In preparation for next week’s lectures (Oct 11th-15th) read slides 2.31-2.98. Also read Vittinghoff Chapter 1 and Chapter 
2, up to and including Section 2.3.
